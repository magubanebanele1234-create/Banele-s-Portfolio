# Gemini Sentiment Analysis Dashboard (Week 5)

## Overview
An interactive dashboard that analyzes sentiment in text data, allowing users to understand emotional tone in customer reviews, social media posts, or other textual content. Users can input text directly or upload files. The system performs multi-class sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral), provides confidence scoring, extracts keywords highlighting sentiment drivers, and supports batch processing for multiple texts.

The dashboard also includes visualizations showing sentiment distribution, comparative analysis between different texts or data sources, and explanation features highlighting why a text received a specific sentiment score. Results can be exported in CSV, JSON, or PDF formats.

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Streamlit  
- NLP API integration (e.g., Hugging Face, AWS Comprehend)

## Deliverables
- GitHub repository with complete source code  
- Deployed application  
- Accuracy report including analysis of at least 50 sample texts, confusion matrix, performance metrics, and discussion of API limitations  
- 3-minute demonstration video  
- Documentation covering API selection, implementation challenges, and user guide with examples
